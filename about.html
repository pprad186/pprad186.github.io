        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            COMP3612 Assign 1 began with a simple belief: that every programmer deserves clothes that
            not only look exceptional but feel extraordinary. Founded in 2025 by Your Name, our company 
            emerged from a shared frustration with the compromise between quality and affordability in 
            the coding attire market, as well as a strong desire to get an A grade in COMP3612.
